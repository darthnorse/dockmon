# DockMon v2.1 Deployment Feature - RED Phase Complete ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Phase:** Week 4 - Frontend TDD (RED Phase)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All tests written, ready for implementation

## Summary

**The RED phase of TDD is COMPLETE!** We have written comprehensive E2E tests for the deployment feature BEFORE implementing any UI. This ensures:

- ✅ Clear requirements (tests define what needs to be built)
- ✅ No ambiguity (tests show exact user workflows)
- ✅ Quality assurance (tests will verify implementation)
- ✅ No manual testing needed (automated verification)

## Test Execution Strategy

### RED Phase Verification
Tests are expected to FAIL because deployment UI doesn't exist yet. This is the correct TDD approach:

```bash
# To verify RED phase (tests should fail):
cd ui
npx playwright test deployments.spec.ts --reporter=list

# Expected result: All tests FAIL (no deployment UI exists)
# ✅ This confirms RED phase is successful!
```

### What Tests Are Looking For

#### Navigation
- `[data-testid="nav-deployments"]` - Sidebar link
- Route: `/deployments` - Deployments page

#### Deployment Form
- `[data-testid="new-deployment-button"]` - Create deployment button
- `[data-testid="deployment-form"]` - Deployment form modal/page
- Form fields: `input[name="name"]`, `input[name="image"]`, etc.
- `[data-testid="create-deployment-submit"]` - Submit button

#### Progress Display
- `[data-testid="deployment-progress"]` - Progress bar
- `[role="progressbar"]` - Accessible progress indicator
- `[data-testid="layer-progress"]` - Layer-by-layer details
- Progress text: Shows percentage (0-100%)
- Speed indicator: Shows MB/s

#### Status Indicators
- `[data-testid="deployment-completed"]` - Success state
- `[data-testid="deployment-error"]` - Error state
- `[data-testid="deployment-rolled-back"]` - Rollback state

#### Template Management
- `[data-testid="templates-link"]` - Open templates
- `[data-testid="new-template-button"]` - Create template
- `[data-testid="template-form"]` - Template form
- Template fields: `name`, `description`, `definition`

#### Security Validation
- `[data-testid="security-validation-error"]` - Security errors
- `[data-testid="security-warning"]` - Security warnings
- `[data-testid="security-violations-list"]` - List of violations

## Expected User Workflows (Defined by Tests)

### 1. Create & Execute Deployment
```
User clicks "Deployments" in sidebar
→ Navigates to /deployments
→ Clicks "New Deployment"
→ Fills form (name, image, host)
→ Clicks "Create"
→ Deployment created (planning state)
→ Clicks "Execute"
→ Shows progress bar (0% → 100%)
→ Shows layer-by-layer progress
→ Shows download speeds
→ Deployment completes successfully
```

### 2. Use Template
```
User clicks "New Deployment"
→ Clicks "From Template"
→ Selects template from list
→ Fills template variables
→ Form prefilled with rendered values
→ Clicks "Create"
→ Deployment created with template config
```

### 3. Security Validation
```
User creates deployment with privileged: true
→ Clicks "Create"
→ Shows CRITICAL security error
→ Explains why it's dangerous
→ Deployment BLOCKED (cannot proceed)
```

### 4. Concurrent Deployments
```
User creates 3 deployments
→ Executes all 3 simultaneously
→ Each shows independent progress bar
→ Each receives correct WebSocket updates
→ All 3 complete without interference
```

## WebSocket Events (Defined by Tests)

### Events Expected During Deployment

```typescript
// 1. After creating deployment
{
  "type": "deployment_created",
  "data": {
    "id": "host:deployment_id",
    "name": "my-deployment",
    "status": "planning"
  }
}

// 2. During execution (simple progress)
{
  "type": "deployment_progress",
  "data": {
    "host_id": "...",
    "entity_id": "deployment_id",
    "progress": 45,  // 0-100
    "stage": "pulling",
    "message": "Pulling image..."
  }
}

// 3. During execution (layer progress - like updates!)
{
  "type": "deployment_layer_progress",
  "data": {
    "host_id": "...",
    "entity_id": "deployment_id",
    "overall_progress": 45,

        "percent": 50
      }
    ],
    "total_layers": 8,
    "remaining_layers": 5,
    "summary": "Downloading 3 of 8 layers (45%) @ 12.5 MB/s",
    "speed_mbps": 12.5
  }
}

// 4. On success
{
  "type": "deployment_completed",
  "data": {
    "id": "host:deployment_id",
    "status": "completed"
  }
}

// 5. On failure
{
  "type": "deployment_failed",
  "data": {
    "id": "host:deployment_id",
    "status": "failed",
    "error_message": "Image not found: 404"
  }
}

// 6. On rollback
{
  "type": "deployment_rolled_back",
  "data": {
    "id": "host:deployment_id",
    "status": "rolled_back"
  }
}
```

## Comparison with Backend

### Backend (Week 3)
- **Unit Tests:** 62/62 passing (100%)
- **Integration Tests:** 21/21 passing (100%)
- **Status:** 100% production-ready
- **Approach:** TDD (tests first, then implementation)

### Frontend (Week 4)
- **E2E Tests Written:** ~90 comprehensive tests
- **E2E Tests Passing:** 0 (expected - no UI yet)
- **Status:** RED phase complete, ready for GREEN phase
- **Approach:** TDD (tests first, then implementation) ✅

**Same rigorous approach as backend!** This ensures frontend will be production-ready with zero manual testing needed.

---

## Lessons from Backend TDD Success

1. **Write tests first** → Know exactly what to build
2. **Tests define requirements** → No ambiguity
3. **Tests catch bugs early** → Fix during development, not after
4. **Comprehensive coverage** → Confidence in production
5. **Zero manual testing** → Automated verification

**We're applying the same winning strategy to the frontend!**
