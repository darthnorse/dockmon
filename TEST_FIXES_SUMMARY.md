# Deployment Health Check Tests - Fixes Summary

## Current Status
- **Phase**: GREEN Phase - ✅ COMPLETE (All 4 tests passing)
- **File**: `backend/tests/integration/test_deployment_health_checks.py`
- **Tests**: 4/4 integration tests PASSING (100%)
- **Goal**: Verify deployments wait for container health before completing ✅

## Completed Fixes

### 1. ✅ Added test_database_manager fixture (backend/tests/conftest.py)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_database_manager(test_db):
    """Create a mock DatabaseManager for testing."""
    from unittest.mock import Mock
    from contextlib import contextmanager

    mock_db = Mock()

    @contextmanager
    def get_session_cm():
        yield test_db

    mock_db.get_session = get_session_cm
    return mock_db
```

### 2. ✅ Updated executor.py to extract container config (deployment/executor.py:196-205)
```python
# Parse definition
definition = json.loads(deployment.definition)

if deployment.deployment_type == 'container':
    container_config = definition.get('container', {})
    await self._execute_container_deployment(session, deployment, container_config)
elif deployment.deployment_type == 'stack':
    await self._execute_stack_deployment(session, deployment, definition)
```

### 3. ✅ Fixed deployment status in tests
Changed all occurrences from `status="pending"` to `status="planning"` (4 places)
Changed all occurrences from `current_stage="pending"` to `current_stage="planning"` (4 places)

### 4. ✅ Updated test method signatures to include test_database_manager
All 4 test methods now have `test_database_manager` parameter

### 5. ✅ Updated all executor creations from test_db to test_database_manager
All 4 lines: `executor = DeploymentExecutor(mock_event_bus, mock_docker_monitor, test_database_manager)`

### 6. ✅ Added image pull mocking to first test (line 225-235)

## All Fixes Completed ✅

### Fix 1: ✅ Added image pull mocking to all 3 remaining tests
- ✅ test_deployment_fails_with_unhealthy_container (line 309-316)
- ✅ test_deployment_fails_with_container_crash (line 386-393)
- ✅ test_deployment_respects_configured_timeout (line 503-510)

### Fix 2: ✅ Fixed executor.py state management issues
- Removed invalid 'running' status (line 377 - now uses state machine 'completed')
- Changed execute_deployment return type from None -> bool
- Added return True on success, return False on failure (instead of raising exceptions)

### Fix 3: ✅ Fixed crashed container cleanup
- Added cleanup code for containers that crash during startup (executor.py:339-347)
- Crashed containers are now properly removed before error is raised

### Fix 4: ✅ Updated test expectations
- Changed expected status from "running" to "completed" (matches state machine)
- Changed all mock_event_bus from Mock to AsyncMock (fixes "can't be used in 'await'" errors)

**Pattern to apply** (same for all 3):
```python
# BEFORE:
with patch('deployment.executor.async_docker_call') as mock_async_call:
    async def passthrough(func, *args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    mock_async_call.side_effect = passthrough

    result = await executor.execute_deployment(deployment.id)

# AFTER:
with patch('deployment.executor.async_docker_call') as mock_async_call, \
     patch.object(executor.image_pull_tracker, 'pull_with_progress', new_callable=AsyncMock) as mock_pull:
    async def passthrough(func, *args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    mock_async_call.side_effect = passthrough

    # Mock image pull to skip actual pulling (we're testing health checks, not image pull)
    mock_pull.return_value = None  # Pull succeeded

    result = await executor.execute_deployment(deployment.id)
```

### Fix 2: Ensure AsyncMock is imported at top of test file

Check if line 18 has `from unittest.mock import Mock, AsyncMock, patch`
If not, add `AsyncMock` to the import.

## How to Run Tests After Fixes

```bash
cd /Users/patrikrunald/Documents/CodeProjects/dockmon/backend

# Run all deployment health check tests
env DOCKMON_DATA_DIR=/tmp/dockmon_test_data python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_deployment_health_checks.py -v

# Run individual test
env DOCKMON_DATA_DIR=/tmp/dockmon_test_data python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_deployment_health_checks.py::TestDeploymentHealthCheckSuccess::test_deployment_succeeds_with_healthy_container -xvs
```

## Test Results (Final)

All 4 tests PASSING ✅:
1. ✅ test_deployment_succeeds_with_healthy_container - Deployment succeeds when container becomes healthy
2. ✅ test_deployment_fails_with_unhealthy_container - Deployment fails when container becomes unhealthy
3. ✅ test_deployment_fails_with_container_crash - Deployment fails when container crashes
4. ✅ test_deployment_respects_configured_timeout - Deployment respects configured timeout from GlobalSettings

**Test Run Command:**
```bash
cd backend && env DOCKMON_DATA_DIR=/tmp/dockmon_test_data python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_deployment_health_checks.py -v
```

**Result:** 4 passed, 13 warnings in 30.47s

## Summary of Changes

### Backend Files Modified:
1. **backend/deployment/executor.py** (3 changes):
   - Line 165: Changed return type `-> None` to `-> bool`
   - Line 217: Added `return True` on success
   - Line 236: Changed `raise` to `return False` on failure
   - Line 381: Removed `deployment.status = 'running'` (let state machine handle it)
   - Lines 339-347: Added cleanup for crashed containers

2. **backend/tests/integration/test_deployment_health_checks.py** (8 changes):
   - Lines 218, 301, 378, 492: Changed `Mock()` to `AsyncMock()` for event bus (4 locations)
   - Lines 225-234, 309-318, 386-395, 503-512: Added image pull mocking (4 locations)
   - Line 242: Changed expected status from "running" to "completed"

### Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

The core deployment feature is now production-ready. Optional enhancements from the roadmap:
1. Phase 5: Docker Compose stack deployment (YAML file support)
2. Phase 6: Template library expansion
3. Additional E2E testing for edge cases

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified in GREEN Phase:
1. `backend/utils/container_health.py` - Created (107 lines) - Shared health check utility
2. `backend/updates/update_executor.py` - Refactored to use shared utility (removed 73 lines of duplicate code)
3. `backend/deployment/executor.py` - Added health check validation after container starts (lines 339-377)
4. `backend/tests/conftest.py` - Added test_database_manager fixture
5. `backend/tests/integration/test_deployment_health_checks.py` - Fixed to use proper mocks and database manager

### Key Implementation Details:
- Health check logic extracted to `utils/container_health.py::wait_for_container_health()`
- Respects user-configured timeout from `GlobalSettings.health_check_timeout_seconds` (default 60s)
- If Docker HEALTHCHECK configured: Polls for "healthy" status (up to timeout)
- If no HEALTHCHECK: Waits 3s for stability, verifies still running
- Short-circuits immediately when "healthy" or "unhealthy" detected
- On unhealthy: Stops and removes failed container, marks deployment as failed
- On healthy: Marks deployment as "running" with 100% progress

## Database Schema Fix Applied
- Added `display_name` and `created_by` columns to deployments table (from design spec lines 116, 124)
- Updated migration `005_v2_1_0_upgrade.py` to include these fields
- Updated `database.py` Deployment model

## Docker Container Status
- Container rebuilt with fresh database (volumes reset)
- Migration 005_v2_1_0 applied successfully
- Backend running at http://127.0.0.1:8080
