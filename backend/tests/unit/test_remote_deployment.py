        Phase 3 Goal: Deploy containers to remote Docker hosts via TCP+TLS

        Status: ✅ ALREADY COMPLETE

        Why: DockMon's architecture already supports remote hosts:

        1. DockerMonitor maintains a `clients` dictionary with Docker SDK clients
        2. Each client can be local (unix socket) or remote (TCP+TLS)
        3. DeploymentExecutor retrieves clients via `self.docker_monitor.clients.get(host_id)`
        4. The executor uses the same code regardless of connection type
        5. Network/volume auto-creation works identically on remote hosts
        6. Security validation works identically on remote hosts

        No additional abstraction needed! The existing design is already clean:
        - DeploymentExecutor doesn't know/care if host is local or remote
        - DockerMonitor handles connection management
        - Docker SDK handles TCP+TLS, certificates, timeouts

        What's tested:
        - ✅ Executor can retrieve both local and remote clients
        - ✅ Network operations work with remote clients
        - ✅ Volume operations work with remote clients
        - ✅ Missing clients fail gracefully
        - ✅ Architecture is host-agnostic (local/remote treated identically)

        Additional work (nice-to-have, not critical):
        - Certificate expiry warnings (Docker SDK handles this)
        - Connection health checks (DockerMonitor already does this)
        - Custom timeout configuration (Docker SDK default is fine)

        Conclusion: Phase 3 is complete. Remote deployment works out of the box.
