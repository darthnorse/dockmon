FAQ

Q: What does "competitive with DockMon's products or services" mean?

A: This means you cannot offer DockMon as a hosted/managed service to third
   parties for a fee. Examples of prohibited uses:
   - Offering DockMon as a SaaS product to customers
   - Embedding DockMon in a commercial monitoring platform sold to others
   - Providing DockMon hosting as a commercial service

   Examples of permitted uses:
   - Using DockMon internally in your company (any size)
   - Using DockMon to monitor your customers' infrastructure as part of
     consulting/MSP services (not as a standalone product)
   - Contributing improvements back to the project
   - Forking and modifying for your own use

Q: What happens after the Change Date?

A: After the Change Date (2 years from release), that version automatically
   converts to Apache License 2.0, becoming fully permissive open source with
   explicit patent grants and trademark protection.

Q: Can I contribute to DockMon?

A: Yes! Contributions are welcome and do NOT require a CLA. By contributing,
   you agree your contributions are licensed under the same BSL terms.

Q: Can I get a commercial license?

A: Yes! Contact us via GitHub issues for commercial licensing inquiries if
   your use case conflicts with the Additional Use Grant.

Q: Why BSL instead of AGPL or MIT?

A: BSL protects against competitors while remaining contributor-friendly:
   - No CLAs required (unlike AGPL + dual licensing)
   - Eventually becomes fully open source (builds trust)
   - Allows all legitimate use cases while preventing direct competition
   - Used successfully by Sentry, CockroachDB, MariaDB, and others
