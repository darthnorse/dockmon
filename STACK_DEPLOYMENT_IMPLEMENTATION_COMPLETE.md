# Docker Compose Stack Deployment - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Version**: DockMon v2.1

---

## Summary

The Docker Compose stack deployment feature has been fully implemented following the TDD methodology outlined in `docs/deployment_v2_1_implementation_spec.md`. This feature allows users to deploy multi-service Docker Compose stacks through the DockMon UI.

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Compose Parsing & Validation (COMPLETE)

**Day 1-2: TDD RED Phase**
- ✅ Created `backend/tests/unit/test_compose_parser.py` (21 tests)
- ✅ Created `backend/tests/unit/test_compose_validation.py` (19 tests)
- ✅ All tests failing with NotImplementedError (RED phase confirmed)

**Day 3-5: TDD GREEN Phase**
- ✅ Implemented `backend/deployment/compose_parser.py` (140 lines)
  - YAML parsing with safe loader
  - Variable substitution (`${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}`)
  - ComposeParseError exception handling
- ✅ Implemented `backend/deployment/compose_validator.py` (155 lines)
  - YAML safety validation (prevents code execution)
  - Required fields validation
  - Service configuration validation
  - Dependency cycle detection
  - Topological sort for service startup order
- ✅ Test Results: **40/40 tests passing** (GREEN phase complete)

### Week 2: Stack Orchestration (COMPLETE)

**Day 1-2: TDD RED Phase**
- ✅ Created `backend/tests/unit/test_stack_orchestrator.py` (19 tests)
- ✅ Created stub `backend/deployment/stack_orchestrator.py`
- ✅ All tests failing with NotImplementedError (RED phase confirmed)

**Day 3-5: TDD GREEN Phase**
- ✅ Implemented `backend/deployment/stack_orchestrator.py` (405 lines)
  - Service grouping by dependency level (topological sort)
  - Network creation before services
  - Volume creation before services
  - Progress tracking across multiple services
  - Rollback operations for partial failures
  - Stack-level operations (stop/start/remove all)
  - Service config mapping (Compose → Docker SDK)
- ✅ Integrated with `backend/deployment/executor.py`
  - Added `_execute_stack_deployment` method (206 lines)
  - Full orchestration pipeline: validate → parse → create networks → create volumes → deploy services
  - Service-level metadata tracking with `service_name` field
- ✅ Test Results: **19/19 tests passing** (GREEN phase complete)

### Week 3: API & UI Integration (COMPLETE)

**API Endpoints** ✅
- Existing `/api/deployments` endpoints already support stack type
- `POST /api/deployments` accepts `deployment_type: 'stack'`
- `definition.compose_yaml` field contains the Compose YAML
- No additional endpoints needed - generic deployment infrastructure works perfectly

**UI Components** ✅
- Re-enabled stack option in `ui/src/features/deployments/components/DeploymentForm.tsx`
- Stack deployment UI already implemented (lines 411-448):
  - Compose YAML textarea input
  - Validation for required YAML
  - Proper form handling for stack type

**Deployment** ✅
- UI built and deployed to container
- Backend files deployed to container
- Container restarted successfully
- All services initialized correctly

---

## Architecture

### Stack Deployment Flow

```
User submits Compose YAML
    ↓
POST /api/deployments (type='stack')
    ↓
DeploymentExecutor.create_deployment()
    ↓
Background execution: execute_deployment()
    ↓
_execute_stack_deployment()
    ├─→ ComposeValidator.validate_yaml_safety()
    ├─→ ComposeParser.parse() [with variables]
    ├─→ ComposeValidator.validate_dependencies()
    ├─→ StackOrchestrator.plan_deployment()
    │   ├─→ Create networks
    │   ├─→ Create volumes
    │   └─→ Create services (in dependency order)
    ├─→ For each service group:
    │   ├─→ Pull image
    │   ├─→ Create container
    │   ├─→ Start container
    │   └─→ Create deployment_metadata (with service_name)
    └─→ Mark deployment as committed
```

### Rollback Strategy

If deployment fails before commitment:
1. Stop all created containers (reverse order)
2. Remove all created containers (reverse order)
3. Remove created networks (non-external only)
4. Deployment status → `rolled_back`

---

## Key Features

### Security
- ✅ YAML safety validation prevents arbitrary code execution
- ✅ Dangerous tags (`!!python/object`, etc.) are rejected
- ✅ External networks/volumes are never deleted

### Dependency Management
- ✅ Topological sort for service startup order
- ✅ Parallel deployment of independent services
- ✅ Cycle detection (self-cycles, simple cycles, complex cycles)

### Progress Tracking
- ✅ Layer-by-layer progress (per service)
- ✅ Weighted phase progress (pull: 40%, create: 20%, start: 20%, health: 20%)
- ✅ Multi-service aggregation

### Metadata Tracking
- ✅ Each service in stack gets deployment_metadata record
- ✅ `service_name` field identifies service within stack
- ✅ `deployment_id` links all services to parent stack deployment
- ✅ Composite key format: `{host_id}:{deployment_id}`

### Variable Substitution
- ✅ `${VAR_NAME}` format supported
- ✅ `${VAR_NAME:-default_value}` with defaults
- ✅ Nested variable references
- ✅ Error on missing required variables

---

## Unsupported Features (v2.1)

The following Compose features are **not supported** in v2.1:
- ❌ `build:` context (requires Docker build API integration)
- ❌ Health check dependency conditions
- ❌ Custom networks with IPAM configuration
- ❌ Secrets and configs (requires Docker Swarm)
- ❌ Deploy specifications (replicas, resources, etc.)

These can be added in future versions if needed.

---

## Deployment Verification

### Backend Deployment
```bash
✅ Type check passed
✅ Build successful
✅ Files deployed to container:
   - compose_parser.py
   - compose_validator.py
   - stack_orchestrator.py
   - executor.py (updated)
✅ Container restarted
✅ Services initialized: "Deployment services initialized"
```

### UI Deployment
```bash
✅ Type check passed
✅ Build successful (2.38s)
✅ dist/ deployed to container
✅ Stack option visible in deployment form
```

---

## How to Use

### Via UI

1. Navigate to Deployments page
2. Click "New Deployment"
3. Select deployment type: **Docker Compose Stack**
4. Paste your `docker-compose.yml` content
5. Select target host
6. Click "Create Deployment"
7. Monitor progress in real-time

### Via API

```bash
POST /api/deployments
{
  "name": "my-stack",
  "deployment_type": "stack",
  "host_id": "c88e807e-6733-4fc1-8d1c-7451bf7564c2",
  "definition": {
    "compose_yaml": "version: '3.8'\nservices:\n  web:\n    image: nginx:alpine\n    ports:\n      - '80:80'"
  },
  "rollback_on_failure": true
}

POST /api/deployments/{deployment_id}/execute
```

---

## Example Compose File

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      - frontend
    depends_on:
      - api
    restart: unless-stopped

  api:
    image: node:18-alpine
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://db:5432/app
    restart: unless-stopped

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    networks:
      - backend
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  db_data:
    driver: local
```

**Deployment behavior**:
1. Creates networks: `frontend`, `backend`
2. Creates volume: `db_data`
3. **Group 1** (parallel): Starts `db` (no dependencies)
4. **Group 2** (parallel): Starts `api` (depends on `db`)
5. **Group 3** (parallel): Starts `web` (depends on `api`)
6. Labels all containers with `com.docker.compose.project=my-stack`

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Build Support**: Add Docker build API integration for `build:` context
2. **Health Check Dependencies**: Support `depends_on` with health check conditions
3. **Stack Templates**: Pre-built templates for common stacks (LAMP, MEAN, etc.)
4. **Stack Updates**: In-place updates for running stacks (rolling updates)
5. **Stack Logs**: Aggregated logs across all services in stack
6. **E2E Tests**: Playwright tests for full stack deployment workflow
