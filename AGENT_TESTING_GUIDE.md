# DockMon Agent v2.2.0 - Testing Guide

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Testing

## Overview

The DockMon Agent v2.2.0 UI has been successfully built and deployed to the running container. The backend agent infrastructure is active and the UI components are ready for testing.

## Deployment Status

✅ UI Components Built
✅ UI Deployed to Container (`/usr/share/nginx/html/`)
✅ Backend Agent Files Deployed (`/app/backend/agent/`)
✅ Backend Restarted Successfully
✅ Agent API Endpoints Registered
✅ Navigation Link Added to Sidebar

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Access the UI

1. Open your browser and navigate to DockMon:
   ```
   https://localhost:8001
   ```

2. Login with admin credentials:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`

### 2. Navigate to Agents Page

1. Look for "Agents" in the left sidebar navigation (should appear after "Hosts")
2. Click on "Agents" link
3. Verify the page loads without errors

**Expected Result:**
- Page displays with title "Agents"
- Description: "Manage DockMon agents installed on remote Docker hosts"
- "Register New Agent" card is visible
- "No Agents Registered" message (if no agents connected yet)

### 3. Test Token Generation

1. Click the "Generate Token" button in the "Register New Agent" card
2. Wait for token generation

**Expected Result:**
- Success toast notification appears
- Token is displayed in a copyable field
- Docker installation command is displayed with the token pre-filled
- Expiry timer shows "15 minutes" or counting down
- "Generate New Token" button is available

### 4. Test Copy-to-Clipboard

1. Click the copy button next to the token
2. Check if clipboard contains the token
3. Click the "Copy" button on the installation command
4. Check if clipboard contains the full Docker command

**Expected Result:**
- Copy buttons show checkmark icon briefly after clicking
- Clipboard contains the expected content

### 5. Test Agent Registration (If You Have a Remote Docker Host)

1. Copy the Docker installation command
2. On a remote Docker host, run the command (replacing `YOUR_DOCKMON_HOST` with your DockMon server address)
3. Wait for the agent to start and connect
4. Return to the Agents page in the UI

**Expected Result:**
- Agent appears in the "Registered Agents" list
- Agent card shows:
  - Host name (or engine ID if no hostname)
  - Connected status badge (green)
  - Version information
  - Last seen timestamp
  - Registered timestamp
  - Capabilities badges

### 6. Test Agent Status Updates

1. If an agent is connected, observe the status
2. Stop the agent container
3. Wait 10 seconds and refresh the page

**Expected Result:**
- Agent status changes from "Connected" (green) to "Online" (gray) or "Offline" (red)
- Last seen timestamp stops updating

### 7. Test Auto-Refresh

1. With the Agents page open, wait 10 seconds
2. Observe if the agent list refreshes automatically

**Expected Result:**
- Agent list automatically refreshes every 10 seconds
- No page reload required
- Agent statuses update in real-time

## API Endpoint Testing

### Available Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication (session cookie).

#### 1. Generate Registration Token
```bash
POST /api/agent/generate-token
```

#### 2. List All Agents
```bash
GET /api/agent/list
```

#### 3. Get Agent Status
```bash
GET /api/agent/{agent_id}/status
```

#### 4. Agent WebSocket
```
WebSocket /api/agent/ws
```

### Testing with curl (Example)

```bash
# Login first to get session cookie
curl -k -c /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://localhost:8001/api/... \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'

# Generate token
curl -k -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://localhost:8001/api/agent/generate-token

# List agents
curl -k -b /tmp/cookies.txt https://localhost:8001/api/agent/list
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Session
- None - All components deployed successfully
- Backend started without errors
- UI built without errors

### Future Enhancements
- Agent deletion/revocation functionality
- Agent name/label editing
- Bulk operations
- Connection quality metrics
- Agent logs streaming

## Troubleshooting

### UI Not Loading
1. Check nginx is running:
   ```bash
   DOCKER_HOST= docker exec dockmon ps aux | grep nginx
   ```

2. Check UI files are present:
   ```bash
   DOCKER_HOST= docker exec dockmon ls -la /usr/share/nginx/html/
   ```

3. Check browser console for errors

### Backend Not Responding
1. Check backend logs:
   ```bash
   DOCKER_HOST= docker logs dockmon --tail 100
   ```

2. Verify backend is running:
   ```bash
   DOCKER_HOST= docker exec dockmon ps aux | grep uvicorn
   ```

### Agent Won't Connect
1. Check agent logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs <agent-container-name>
   ```

2. Verify network connectivity from agent host to DockMon server
3. Verify token hasn't expired (15-minute timeout)
4. Check token is correct and hasn't been used already

### Database Issues
1. Check if migration ran successfully:
   ```bash
   DOCKER_HOST= docker exec dockmon python3 /app/backend/migrate.py
   ```

2. Verify tables exist:
   ```bash
   DOCKER_HOST= docker exec dockmon python3 -c "from database import engine; from sqlalchemy import inspect; print(inspect(engine).get_table_names())"
   ```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ UI loads without errors
- ✅ Navigation link appears in sidebar
- ✅ Agents page renders correctly
- ✅ Token generation works
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard works
- ⏳ Agent registration works (requires remote host)
- ⏳ Agent status updates work (requires connected agent)
- ⏳ Auto-refresh works (requires connected agent)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Complete Flow:**
   - Generate token
   - Install agent on remote Docker host
   - Verify agent appears in list
   - Verify status updates

2. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update main README.md with agent setup instructions
   - Create agent installation guide
   - Update DOCKMON.md with v2.2.0 features

3. **Release Preparation:**
   - Tag release as v2.2.0
   - Create release notes
   - Build multi-arch agent images
   - Publish to GitHub Container Registry
